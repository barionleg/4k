The goal of the in4k site is to be the central resource about creation of demoscene 4kb intros.

We hope to compile public domain resources into a single site, as well as mirror them (in case of websites closing).

## Links

* [What Are Intros](what-are-intros) - Explanation of what are "intros" and "demos".
* [Sample Intros](sample-intros) - Examples of intros to check out.
* [IN4K Announcement Intro](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=19068)
* [Auld's 4kb Introduction](aulds-4kb-introduction) - Auld's introduction and reasoning for writing 4kb intros.
