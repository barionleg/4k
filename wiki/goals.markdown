It is our pleasure to give the community IN4K - an interactive web portal dedicated to 4 KB intro development.

We aim to provide a common place to collect resources – encouraging coders across the world to collaborate and make this site into a living, breathing, and interactive environment with value to all.
Please use the discussion pages. Please make new pages, and articles (just notify us!). If you need increased access – please let us know! We are making some of this up as we go along!
Above all else – stick with a good spirit of collaboration in these pages. It’s currently win32 focused because that’s our background… but not our limit! Post the first pages on Linux and OS X development!
Learn, share and enjoy!

Oh... and above all else...

CODE 4KBs!!!
