# github Markdown clone
2016-07-26 :: psenough

Cloning old in4k.untergrund.net and in4k.northerndragons.ca (based out of web.archive.org references) on to a github wiki, for easier management, maintenance, ressurection and greater justice!

# Qoob
2010-10-15 :: tonic

Auld has released Qoob, a tiny 3d modeller and library. It takes around 2 KB when compressed, so it may be slightly big for your 4 KB if you plan on adding lots of other stuff as well. It's still very interesting project and worth checking out especially if you think about making 8 KB or 64 KB intros. While you're at it, remember to check out his Graphics Size Coding blog as well.

# Size-optimized synth seminar resources posted
2010-4-30 :: Ferris

2009-08-19 :: Ferris

Ferris of YUP is giving a seminar on size-optimized synth programming at The Gathering 2010. IN4K will host the seminar resources after the seminar.

# Music Tools Update etc.
2009-08-12 :: tonic

Nicely some groups have released usable versions of their tools to make synthesized music for 4 KB intros. More or less recent additions include 4Klang by Alcatraz Software, Sonant by Youth Uprising and PuavoHard Intro Music Composer. Excellent work!
As usual, lack of time is a problem with enhancing the IN4K site. Most of the work goes to fighting spam manually (and updating the simple spam catching system). Always looking for volunteers with strong php, mysql and mediawiki experience. :)

# Custom virtual machine for 4K intros
2007-10-09 :: tonic

XMunkki released the source of IL4 Lisp-ahtava along with source of Rose Shank, a 4 KB intro which contributed in Assembly'07 4k competition. What's special about it is the fact that it uses a custom language with lisp-like syntax and a compiler written in OCaml which generates a custom virtual machine and bytecode for it from the source code. Check out more from the IL4 Lisp-ahtava page.

# OpenGL w/GLSL
2007-05-06 :: tonic

Just posting a "heads up" about the info page of Auld's great Flow2 intro, if you haven't noticed it already. It shows how to use OpenGL with GLSL shaders and all fit that in 1K EXE intro. Check it out: About Flow2!

# Auld's pages are Back
2006-06-14 :: Polaris

# Just an Update
2006-02-28 :: tonic

We have unfortunately been busy with other things, so we haven't been able to keep adding features to IN4K site with number one priority. We still hope you will keep contributing to the site! Just make an account and dive in making a new page. Note that some of the pages are locked from editing in the site structure, to fight against spam content (it has already happened a few times in IN4K as well). We'll try to keep an eye for new stuff and link them in the site structure. And do not hesitate to contact us if you have anything to say.

If you happen to know PHP & MySQL (and maybe even know stuff about MediaWiki customization), and on top of that have some extra time, please consider helping us out. You can also send private messages to tonic in IRCnet if you prefer that way.
And some actual news: Flash 4K Challenge results are out there. Additionally, if 4 KB intros aren't challenging enough for you, try out making 1 KB intros!

# Vote In Flash 4K Challenge
2006-02-01 :: tonic

The Flash 4K Challenge is over and its voting system is now open. Go check the entries and vote!
Be sure to poke around the IN4K site as well. There's a bit of new stuff here and there, especially some goodies submitted by our very active user Auld. Thanks to him for sharing so much!

# Java 4K Game Programming Contest
2005-12-15 :: tonic

# Updates & Flash 4K Challenge
2005-12-09 :: tonic

It's great to see how the site has already started to gather contributions. There's now new Guidelines page, which has a few points about discussing content and creating pages. Also, generic suggestions about whole site should go to the discussion of Suggestions page.

# Bits of Stuff
2005-11-15 :: tonic

Added some introductory texts to the different Platforms, a few other resources, and did some cleanups here and there.

# GO!
2005-11-09 :: tonic

Welcome to IN4K! This is the first ever web portal dedicated to 4KB intro development. Please surf our pages, create accounts, and use our discussion tabs. There is a lot more to do, including addition of existing information from the past. We've barely scratched the surface so far. We hope this will become an interactive resource - where we can benefit and learn from each other.

Questions? Concerns or Suggestions - Please use the site or email us! Your feedback is valuable and welcome!

# Ready... set......
2005-11-07 :: Polaris
