# Auld's List of Useful Links for 4k Inspiration and Development

None of these links is about 4k development. Instead they are a collection of things which *could* be useful in some adapted form.

*   [Paul Bourkes Pages](http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/ "http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/"). Probably inspired more 4ks than anything else. Use the dialogue box in bottom left to chose your subject. Surfaces is a good place to start.
*   [Implicit surfaces Tool](http://www.leweyg.com/download/impview.html "http://www.leweyg.com/download/impview.html")
*   [Useful Maths equations](http://rsp.math.brandeis.edu/3d-xplormath/Surface/gallery.html "http://rsp.math.brandeis.edu/3d-xplormath/Surface/gallery.html")
*   Evaldraw - [Tool for evaluating 2d and 3d equations](http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm#evaldraw "http://advsys.net/ken/download.htm#evaldraw")
*   [Mandelbrot++](http://www.superliminal.com/fractals/bbrot/bbrot.htm "http://www.superliminal.com/fractals/bbrot/bbrot.htm") Dont forget to check out the 4d examples
