Intros are known in the [demoscene](demoscene) as being demos with a limited size. Often having special compos for them at different demoparties. The most popular size formats for intros are 64kb, 4kb and 1kb. On the Amiga, 20kb size is also popular. On the MS-DOS 512byte, 256byte and 128byte are also quite popular. Intros that are less than a kilobyte are usually called "bytetros".

### From the Old school PC demoscene FAQ:

> A Demo is a program that displays a sound, music, and light show, usually in 3D. Demos are very fun to watch, because they seemingly do things that aren't possible on the machine they were programmed on.
> Essentially, demos "show off". They do so in usually one, two, or all three of three following methods:
> * They show off the computer's hardware abilities (3D objects, multi-channel sound, etc.)
> * They show off the creative abilities of the demo group (artists, musicians)
> * They show off the programmer's abilities (fast 3D shaded polygons,complex motion, etc.)
> Demos are an art form. They blend mathematics, programming skill, and creativity into something incredible to watch and listen to.
